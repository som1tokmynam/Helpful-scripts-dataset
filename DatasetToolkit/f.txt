Eyes sparkling with mischief
Eyes twinkling with mischief
the scent of ozone
Maybe, just maybe
Ministrations
Couldnâ€™t help but
Racing with anticipation
Leaves little to the imagination
Shivers down
Shivers up
ozone
Ministration
knuckles turn white
Waggles her eyebrows
A testament to
A moth to a flame
Canvas
Eyes glinted
Camaraderie
Humble abode
Cold and calculating
Unbeknownst to them
Tracing a talon along your jawline
Tracing a claw along your jawline
gaze fixed on you
Iridescent
A dance as old as time
Husky whispers
voice barely above a whisper
Half-lidded eyes
Seductive purrs
Little did they know
Little did she know
Little did he know
Towers over
knuckles white
air thick scent
fingers tightened around
said voice low
casting long shadows
thick scent damp

fingers twitch toward
running hand hair
blood runs cold
sharp enough cut
blood turned ice
air smelled damp
smelled damp earth
said voice rough
rubbing back neck
air smelled salt
laughed sound like
door creaked open
time long time
Rich tapestry
Delve
ready to face
Lean in
that has nothing to do with
Leans in
Leans in close
Don't stop, don't ever stop
Make me yours, claim me
Mind, body, and soul
Another day in your life
a Symphony of
Audible pop
The world narrows
Body and soul
Pleasure and pain
Like a predator stalking its prey
Orchestra
Depths
Dance
Chuckles darkly
Could not help but/couldn't help but
Felt a mix of X and Y
A mischievous glint
Husky voice
A smirk playing on her lips
lips curled into a knowing smile
Playfully smirking
her eyes gleaming with a mischievous glint
Rivulets of
The ball is in your court
The game is on
I don't bite... unless you want me to
Waves of arousal pooling in her belly
Waves of arousal pooling in her core
Kiss-bruised lips
Torn between propriety and desire
The night is still young
Pupils blown wide with pleasure
Tongue darts out
Nails rake angry red lines
Cheeks flame
Inner walls clenching
Heart, body, and soul belong to you
Eyes alight with mirth
Naughty boy
Tracing a finger along your jawline
Oh my...
The atmosphere
Pushing aside a strand of hair
Adam's apple bobbing
Palpable
Bosomy breasts
Looking like the cat that got the cream
Softly but firmly
Siren call/siren's call
Dimly lit
The air is thick
You really know how to treat a lady!
Grins wickedly
Despite herself
Despite himself
Despite themselves
Fiery red hair
Long lashes
Still lodged deep inside him
Still lodged deep inside them
wet pop
admit it
pebbled
perhaps, just perhaps
warring with
arousal pooling in

fiddles with the hem of
a bruising kiss
yours to take

with reckless abandon
eyes searching

but she can't help it
but they can't help it
knuckles turning white
propriety be damned
chestnut eyes
grasps your chin and forces you to meet
what do you say
heart, body and soul belong to you
whether you like it or not
without waiting for a response
as an AI
however, it is important to note
however, it's important
important to remember that
nestled deep within
an ethereal beauty
breathless and eager
whispering words of passion
was soft and gentle
dance of pleasure
sent shockwaves
in a rhythm
wild abandon
exhausted and spent
life would never be the same again
like an electric shock
threatens to consume
lay ahead
for what seemed like
for what felt like
To meet her gaze
To meet his gaze
Bites your ear
cheeks flaming
Her cheeks flaming
Cheeks hollowing
Stars burst behind her eyes
Inner walls clenching around 
Puckered hole
Her wet heat
His wet heat
Their wet heat
whimpers, biting her lip
whimpers, biting his lip
whimpers, biting their lip
Dusky nipples
Slick folds
Still lodged deep inside her
hum with delight

cheeks redden

conspiratorial whispers
with each slow, deliberate movement
tantalizing promise
sway hypnotically
sways hypnotically
catch my drift
the pressure in her loins
the pressure in his loins
penetrated to the hilt
arched spine
shivers running up
grips like a vice
words turn into a purr
straddles your
pooled around her
her bare mound
her bare mounds
revulsion warred with reluctant
revulsion warred with reluctance
journey of mutual understanding
the din of the crowd
steeling herself
steeling himself
heaving with desire
for the sake of keeping things
what seemed like an eternity
what felt like an eternity
sensitive flesh
wet flesh
with each breath
reveling in the satisfaction
finds solace in
haze of pleasure
whatever lies ahead
challenges await
Navigating the complexities of
fingers tightened around
air thick with the scent
air was thick with the scent
casting long shadows
thick with the scent of damp
